# jira-cve-action

- This actions takes a json result from a [aquasecurity/trivy-action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) and creates Jira issues for all the CVEs.  
- The CVE issues will be sub issues of a predefined parent issue.  
- If the parent issue is registered on a sprint board, all CVE sub tickets will be automatically added to the sprint.
- If the workflow is used in multiple GitHub projects on the same Jira project, the CVE issues will be shared and affected GitHub projects are marked on the same issue by adding a project specific version tag.
- The Action can automatically move tickets. If the CVE has no fix version then the issue will be created in a predefined waiting issue state. When the scan result includes a fix version, the corresponding issue will automatically be moved to a ready state.
