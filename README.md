# jira-cve-action

- This actions takes a json result from a [aquasecurity/trivy-action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) and creates Jira issues for all the CVEs.  
- The CVE issues will be sub issues of a predefined parent issue.  
- If the workflow is used in multiple GitHub projects on the same Jira project,  
  the CVE issues will be shared and each GitHub project are marked on the issue by adding a component tag.  
- The issues will be created in the current sprint of the given jira board. 
- If the CVE has no fix version then the issue will be created in a predefined waiting issue state.  
- If the scan result includes a fix version, the corresponding issue will automatically be moved to a ready state.  

## TODO:
- CVE details in issue description
- Error handling
- modularize code
- make some functions optional (component tag, sprint, ...)
